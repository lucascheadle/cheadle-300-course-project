Hello-
Welcome to my spring quarter course project.
My project is going to be an app that provides accurate tidal information based on the user's current location. The API will be NOAA's https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/api/.
As a frequent beachcomber I would like to have an easy way to know what stage the local tide is in at any given point in time

I would also like to include lunar information to enhance the tidal info since the tides are caused by the moon's gravitational pull. Here is a prospective API for that https://www.worldweatheronline.com/developer/api/docs/astronomy-api.aspx.
