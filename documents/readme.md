Hello-
Welcome to my spring quarter course project.
My project is going to be an app that provides accurate tidal information based on the user's current location. The API will be NOAA's https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/api/.
I would also like to include lunar information to enhance the tidal info since the tides are caused by the moon's gravitational pull. Here is a prospective API for that https://www.worldweatheronline.com/developer/api/docs/astronomy-api.aspx.
